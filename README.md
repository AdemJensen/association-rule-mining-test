# Association Rule Mining Test Project

This is a project aim to test the open-source association rule mining library [Orange3](https://orange.biolab.si/). The project is based on the [Market Basket Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_basket_analysis) problem.

## Datasets
There are several datasets provided in this project.

However, to get a better grasp of how different factors affect the performance of AR mining tools, I mainly used generated dummy data to do the trick.

If you want to use the provided datasets, you can find them in the `datasets` folder. There is another readme.md file located under it.
